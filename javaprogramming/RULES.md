# Java Programming Assignment Rules
# Author: Koushal Jha

## I. Administrative Rules
1. DEADLINES: All assignments must be completed within 48 hours.
2. ATTENDANCE: Missing a deadline results in an "Absent" mark. 4 failed assignments will result in removal from the group.
3. REPOSITORY: Push your code to the designated repo immediately after solving each question.
4. AI USAGE: Do not use AI to write code unless explicitly instructed.

## II. File & Project Structure
5. PACKAGES: Every file must include a proper package declaration.
6. QUESTION ID: The Question ID must match the question being solved exactly.
7. NAMING: Use meaningful and descriptive variable names at all times.

## III. Technical Standards
8. IMPORTS: Do not use implicit imports (.*). All imports must be explicit.
9. ARCHITECTURE: 
   - The 'main' method is for Input/Output (I/O) only.
   - All core logic/algorithms must be solved in separate methods.
10. EXCEPTION HANDLING: Properly handle InputMismatchException and other relevant errors.
11. DOCUMENTATION: Provide meaningful comments. Avoid shortcuts; explain the "why" and "how" of your code.
