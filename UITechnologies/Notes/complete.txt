- A hyper text document provides content on screen and naviagates user beyond the content to access details.
- web pages are classfied into 2 types:
    a) Static Page
    b) Dynamic Page

    Static Page:
    ------------
	- Static refers to continuous memory
	- Memory allocated to first request will continue for next set of requests.
	- Static page comprises of same information to display across any number of requests
	- Static page have extensions
	    a) .htm
	    b) .html

    Dynamic Page:

	  How ever the dynamic page composition comprises of business logic in backend.



									HTML
								-------------------
- Hyper Text Markup Language
- Hyper means beyond
- Markup refers to the term marking up, which is a process of preparing our content to present exactly as required.
- HTML is a markup language used to present content on "Browser".


Evolution of HTML
------------------
- Internet started with a browser called "Mosaic".
- CERN labs developed a language called GML later improved as SGML.
- GML & SGML are markup languages used for Mosaic.
	CERN => Council for European Research & Nuclear
	GML  => Genreic Markup Language
	SGML => Standard Generic Markup Language

- Tim Berners developed HTML as super set to GML & SGML in early 1990.
- IETF [ Internet Engineering Task Force ] developed several versions of HTML.
- IETF developed up to 3.1 version.
- WHATWG [ Web Hyper Text Application Technology Work Group ] started , maintaining and envolving HTML since 2004 [ HTML 4 ]
- The latest version of HTML is HTML5. [ 2014 ]

- The popular browsers
    a) Chrome
    b) Firefox
    c) Safari
    d) Edge
    e) Opera
    etc...

1. User Interface
    - UI comprises of tabs, navigation buttons, plugins, workspace etc..
    - UI also comprises of development tools.

2. UI Backend
    - It provides the logic for UI.
    - All UI elements are controlled by using UI backend.
    - If you are using any open source browser then you can customize UI backend.

3. Browser Engine
    - It translates HTML & CSS.
    - Every browser have its own engine, which leads to compatibility issues.
	
	Chrome  	V8 		Blink
	IE		Chakra 		Trident
	Firefox		Gecko		SpiderMonkey	
	Safari		Webkit 		Nitro
	Edge		EdgeHTML 	Chakra
	Opera		Blink		V8

4. JavaScript Interpreter
    - It is responsible for translating JavaScript in browser.
    - In browser JS is translated line-by-line, which is known as interpreting.

5. Rendering Engine
    - Rendering is the process of generating output
    - Every browser have a rendering engine, which is responsible for rendering output generated through HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

6. Networking
    - It handles the request from client.
    - It connects to server and loads all resources requested by client.
    - It allows developers to monitor the resources.

    NOTE: Every webpage loads as a result of browser "DOMContentLoaded" event.

7. Data Persistence
    - Every browser stores data.
    - Data storage in browser can be managed using
	a) Local Storage
	b) Session Storage
	c) Extension Storage
	d) Cache Storage
	e) Cookies 
	etc...
	
    - Storage are temporary & permanent.

			<link>										    <html>
			<rel>	: It specifies the file type   |						<head>
				  "stylesheet" for css	       | ----> 	<link rel = "shortcut icon">		    <title> Web Development </title>
				  "shortcut icon" for favicon  |						    <link rel = "shortcut icon" href= "assets/favicon.ico">
														</head>
			href	: It is hyper reference        |					    </html>	
				  virtual path or file 	       | ----> 	href = "assets/favicon,ico"
													NOTE: . There is no order dependency of element in head section.
		 	syntax: 									      . There is no order dependency of attributes in element.
			    <link rel = "shortcut icon" href = "assets/favicon.ico">


		FAQ: what is difference between "src" and "href"?

--------------
    - Frame splits the window into horizontal and vertical panes.
    - Every frame can display a document embedded into window.
    - It is not embedded into page, it is embedded into browser window.

	syntax:
	    <frameset rows/cols ="15% 70% 15%">
	    	<frame src = ""></frame>
		<frame src = ""></frame>
	    </frameset>

    - when you designing frameset, HTML page can't have body section <body>
    - <frameset> is defined after <head> section.
    - Frames can be nested with rows and columns.
    - Frame can't display any content directly, it requires a HTML page or URL source.
	syntax:
	    <frame name="frameBody" src="home.html"></frame>
